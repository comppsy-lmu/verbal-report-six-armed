TASK_DESCRIPTION = """You will be assigning categories to verbal reports made by participants in the following experiment:

Participants completed 48 rounds of a 36-armed bandit task with the
goal of identifying a single winning bandit within six attempts in each round. That is, 35 of
the bandits, if selected, would return "incorrect" feedback, while just one bandit would
trigger a "correct" message and would terminate the round. Bandits were organised into six
sections numbered 1 to 6, each containing six options labelled with one of the letters from
A to F (in a random order).
The winning bandit in each round followed one of two deterministic six-round sequences
that repeated cyclically. Under the Section-only rule, the section containing the winner
followed a fixed sequence across rounds (1-2-3-4-5-6), while the winning letter within the
section was unpredictable. Under the Section+letter rule, both section and letter followed
a fixed sequence (1-A, 2-B, 3-C, 4-D, 5-E, 6-F). Learning the Section-only rule was sufficient
to succeed in the task, in the sense that the participant would always be able to find the
winning option if they clicked exhaustively on each bandit within the right section (because
there were six options within a section and they had six attempts). For the Section+letter
rule, participants were reliably able to identify the winning bandit on the first trial of each
round. Letter positions were shuffled between rounds, and so the letter pattern was not
confounded with the physical location of the winning bandit.
The task transitioned from the Section-only rule to the Section+letter rule halfway through.
That is, the section that contained the winning option was always predictable, while the
exact letter was only predictable in the second half, starting from round 25.
Before each round, participants predicted the section containing the winning bandit and
rated their confidence. After predicting the section winner, participants then selected
bandits until they found the winner (i.e., round win) or until six unsuccessful trials elapsed
(i.e., round loss).
